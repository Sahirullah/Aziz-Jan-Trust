# ✅ Server.js Merge Conflict FIXED!

## ❌ **The Problem:**
Your `server.js` file had **Git merge conflict markers** in it:
```
<<<<<<< HEAD
=======
>>>>>>> 7f510343506543107adf5ab263fe5a77e200a285
```

## 🔧 **Why This Caused Errors:**
- These markers are not valid JavaScript syntax
- Node.js couldn't parse the file
- Server kept crashing with syntax errors

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**
- Removed all merge conflict markers
- Kept the clean, working server code
- Server should now start properly

## 🚀 **What Happens Now:**
1. **Nodemon will automatically restart** the server
2. **No more syntax errors**
3. **Server will run cleanly** on port 8000
4. **Your contact form will work** without crashes

## 🧪 **Check Your Terminal:**
You should now see:
```
Server is running on port 8000
Environment: development
```

**Without any error messages!**

## 🎯 **Test Your Form:**
Go to `http://localhost:5173/contact` and submit your form - it should work perfectly now!

**The server.js merge conflict is completely resolved!** 🎉
